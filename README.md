#lolPix
lolPix is an cloud based image board, where users can't upload images. Sounds strange right?

## How it works.
Well, how will it work, if the users can't uplaod any images? 
They will be able to publish links in the database. The images will be hosted on bigger, faster hosters and we will only serve as a hub. The only things which will be saved here are: User details, image likes, captions and URL.
